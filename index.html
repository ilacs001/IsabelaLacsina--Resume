        I am a first-generation American. My parents moved here 
        from the Philippines to the United States when they were around 20 years 
        old and had me only 2 years after. Their journey here has always been a 
        huge motivation in my life and I do everything for them. I am a student 
        at the University of California, Riverside for and because of them.<br><br>

       My major is Media and Cultural Studies and I am going to double major in 
       Political Science next quarter as well. I have always been interested in 
       how the media operates and how it influences our daily lives and cultures.
       Once I found out that UCR was one of the only colleges to offer a major 
       that integrates both ideas, I knew that I had to attend. With my parents'
       approval, I applied and got accepted. I have also been very interested in 
       politics as well, for my generation now has a voice in what goes on in the 
       government. We are not only the present but the future and I am interested 
       in giving a voice to the voiceless.<br><br>

      As a first-year student, I did not know what to expect. Although I knew that I loved my major, I was still open to new ideas and career options. I was overwhelmed with the amount of options and decided that the right major will come when I stop looking. As soon as I stopped looking, the opportunity to be part of ASUCR’s Election Committee came up and I took it. Getting first hand experience on how elections work is truly an eye opening experience that I am super grateful for. It has made me realize that political science is something that I am really interested in. I am also a member of UCR’s Filipino Club- Katipunan. Getting in touch with my roots and learning more about where I come from has been a life-changing experience. It has reminded me of why I come to school and that I represent all the Filipinos whenever I accomplish something.  <br><br>
       
       I have a lot of experience with design, specifically Adobe InDesign. I designed my school’s yearbook during my junior year and worked closely with design aspects of our media accounts. We also wrote a lot about current events and I chose to write about politics. I have alway been destined to follow this path, yet never truly considered it until going to college. I have also worked as a research intern in a hospital and learned that that path was not suited for me, although I was told many times before that it was. I then decided to work at a theatre to help my parents out. Working in these two places has helped me gain skills only gained while working.<br><br>
        
        I have so much more to learn and can’t wait to see what is in store. I am so excited to pursue a career that I am truly passionate about. I really want to make some sort of impact on the world- whether big or small.<br><br>
